Thalion is haunted by his past as a soldier, a past that is taken advantage of by Abbathor. Abbathor will show Thalion glimpses of his past in his dreams to try to drive Thalion to insanity. During the feast celebrating the party's victory, Abbathor will take over Thalionâ€™s body and attempt to resurrect Cryovain to use as a weapon against his enemies from his past life.
