Faelyn is found during the party’s first visit to Faelora to be the long-lost heir to the elven throne. Apollyon Nesta begs the party to kill King Ailwin Nesta, so he can take his place on the throne and “Right the wrongs that his father has made against the people of Western Valmora”. It is revealed when the party returns to Eterna that Apollyon was planning on assassinating Warwick Vermund and start an elven uprising across Western Valmora. The party fights Apollyon, and if they defeat him, Faelyn is appointed queen of Eledrithil.
