Upon the defeat of Cryovain, the party returns to Phandalin to find that there’s a group named the Redbrands causing trouble. Upon interrogating a ruffian in town, the party will discover that they have set up a base of operations inside Tresendar Manor. The party will make their way through Transendor Manor, battling the ruffians and encountering Glasstaff. Upon Glasstaff’s defeat, they will learn that the redbrands are being funded by Wolveswall’s rival guild, Cobrakark. 

  

The party will travel to ‘Kipper Hollow’ where they will find that Cobrakark is exploiting the town's residents for their money as “protection”. At the same time as their arrival, Nezznar the Spider is having a meeting with Tarook Talon about their progress in the findings of a “Wave Echo Cave” and the obtaining of a strange magical black rock (which so happens to be a shard of the shattered obelisk). The party will take on Cobrakark and run into Ari McQueen, who is also looking to stop Cobrakark for the sake of the townspeople. When the party encounters Tarook Talon, he summons a guard draped in a dark hood with a black mask, with the obelisk shard stabbed into his chest, with what looks like green veins extending outwards across his chest. This guard (we’ll call him Billy) carries a pistol similar to Steve’s and, upon his defeat, can be looted for a +1 pistol. Billy is followed by 2 Shardbound Husks. Billy will be revealed to be Steve and Ari’s father. If Steve tries to bring Billy back to his senses, on a successful DC15 Charisma (Persuasion) throw, Billy will throw his pistol to Steve and ask him to “End it once and for all”. If the party cannot finish him off (or somehow remove the obelisk without killing him), Billy will begin to mutate from the influence of the obelisk shard. When Billy dies, the shard splinters and green cracks form in the ground. The people will begin to get sick, and on a failed WIS saving throw (DC 12, daily), they begin to get violent. Every 3 days, on a roll of 17 or higher, 2 townspeople will mutate into an aberrant spawn. Every night, the cracks pulse like a heartbeat.

  

The party will defeat Tarook Talon, and Nezznar will escape. Upon searching Tarook’s office, the party will find a map to the hidden ‘Wave Echo Cave’. Wave Echo Cave will be run as it normally is (with the exception of Kipper Hollow being infected by the shard), and the second half of The Shattered Obelisk will run as normal. Ari will help Kipper Hollow rebuild and will act as their guardian from then on.

  

When Wave Echo Cave is finished, the party will learn that the only way to remove the infection from the town is to contain it within a “host”, with Steve (hopefully) taking on the mantle of saving his town from the corruption. The infection inside him will continue to grow throughout the campaign until they destroy the obelisk, and the shard threatens to kill him. Steve must succeed 3 DC16 saving throws ([see table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8KGRbOwzBk3suLgT9hqJMWJULsTSAx1lmRI_a2nrN0/edit?tab=t.p71ozqta54oh)) or die. His party can use the help action or supportive spells to give him advantage (so will saying the right words if he’s convincing enough). Upon the success of the destruction of the shard, Steve gains the passive abilities:

  

**Immunity to being charmed or frightened.  
  

**Aesthetic feature: Faint green scar patterns across his chest.  
  

**Once per long rest, Steve can add +1d4 to a saving throw vs. magic (residue of mental fortitude).

  

**Steve can hear the memories of objects that he touches when focusing
