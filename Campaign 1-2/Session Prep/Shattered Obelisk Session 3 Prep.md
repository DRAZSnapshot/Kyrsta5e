## Introduction
“In our last session: The party went to Kipper Hollow. Steve McQueen reunited with his sister Ali McQueen. The party, Alvine aside, had their fortunes told. The Party gambled until Steve and Banshee gained access to the VIP lounge. Tarook Talon was confronted, leading to an encounter against a corrupted William McQueen. And Steve was blown up by explosive traps in the treasury and immediately revived by Banshee.”

## Corruption in Kipper Hollow
The party learns that the corruption from the shard is spreading across the town and infecting the townspeople. 

#### Steve Awakens
Steve is quickly pulled out of the dream where he is communicating with his father to find before him lay shards of gold scattered across the treasury floor. The Party can continue searching to see if they can find anything in the office retaining knowledge of the location of Wave Echo Cave by making a DC15 Investigation check every hour that they are searching. If they give up, the map will be brought to them later.

#### The Cracks of Corruption
The party leaves the casino to find that the cracks from the shard have spread across the town and some of the townspeople have begun to look sick. Ali is in the town square helping with the sick. Ali explains the situation to the party and the town master will greet them, offering a few rooms in the inn for free as a thank you for driving Tarook away.

#### Thalion’s Dream
Later that night, Thalion is confronted in his dreams by Abbathor, **“a tall figure, about 8 feet tall, but still has the build of a dwarf, clad in leather armor and furs, sits on a throne across the opening of a deep dark cave. His green eyes focused on Thalion”**. trying to stir the greed deep inside him, telling him how “he could have had so much more gold if Steve McQueen hadn’t set off the trap” and that “Steve has more gold than he could ever need, he surely won’t miss if some of it disappears”. After this dream, Thalion has to make a DC15 Charisma saving throw whenever he sees any lose items or purses to resist his growing greed.

#### The Map to Wave Echo Cave
When the party awakes in the morning, Ali and the town master will tell them about a map that was found in one of the bookshelves in Tarook’s office, leading to Wave Echo Cave. The party can find a blacksmith in the town square if they need to repair anything or want something made for them, otherwise, they head out to wave echo cave.

## Wave Echo Cave
This chapter runs pretty much normally, besides the inclusion of Tarook Talon

#### Arrival
The Party arrives at Wave Echo Cave and run the chapter as usual.

#### The Confrontation
The Party reaches the Temple Of Dumathoin, where they will meet Nezznar and Tarook once again. Tarook will manipulate Nezznar and his 2 bugbears into fighting the party and if the party prevails, he will fight them himself. If the party wipes during this encounter, Abbathor takes control of Thalion temporarily and finishes Tarook off.

#### The Priest’s Quarters
Past the locked door to the priest’s quarters, is a goblin researcher who put the shard in William’s chest. If questioned, he will reveal that the only way to remove it’s curse on Kipper Hollow is for it to find a new “host”, which can be found by having someone touch the shard and absorb it. If the party kills the goblin researcher, I guess kipper hollow is doomed.

#### Return to Kipper Hollow/Phandalin
The party leaves Wave Echo Cave and returns to either Kipper Hollow or Phandalin. If the party chooses to return to Kipper Hollow, during one of the nights, Thalion will talk to Abbathor again in his dreams. If the party chooses to return to Phandalin, Thalion won’t have time to talk to him.

## The Hope bearer of Kipper Hollow
The party returns to Kipper Hollow, save the town from the curse upon it, and the god “Daniel” gains new followers.

#### Arrival
As the party is entering town, Droop is showing off his magic, “This is my friend… uh… Forg.” He shows off his frog familiar, “Ribbit” the frog says. The party enters town to find that the townspeople are sick, some are even beginning the mutation phase. Ali can be found in the town square, helping keep order.

#### An Inevitable Sacrifice
Ali asks the party if they’ve learnt anything of a way to remove the curse, in which when being told, will make her way to the casino and attempt to absorb the shard, hopefully being intervened by one of the players who will instead absorb the shard.

### Post Mortem
