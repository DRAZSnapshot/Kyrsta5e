Thalion was hit full blast by the explosion from the greed statue, downing him and unknowingly putting a curse on him. Whenever Thalion sees treasure or items in the shop or in public, he must make a Charisma saving throw of 10 (15 if revived), or else he cannot resist the temptation of taking what he believes is his.

Sometimes in his dreams, Thalion can see and even speak to the curse, which refers to itself as his greed, later to be revealed as Abbathor himself. Abbathor’s goal is to completely take control over Thalion’s body which he will attempt during a solar eclipse which conveniently takes place during the feast at the end of the campaign and will serve as the last encounter of the campaign and will feature an 8th level paladin with [Thalion’s stats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/129617573) + all of the spells from the [trickery domain](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Trickery_domain#Spells). Abbathor can only be defeated by storing his curse inside the Holy Symbol held by Banshee or by killing Thalion.

  

Before Abbathor takes control of Thalion, if Thalion is to take enough damage to get downed or outright die, Abbathor will speak to him about letting his greed for life take over, resulting in a critical success and bringing Thalion back to full hp. If Thalion has been revived by Abbathor, his Greed Saving Throw is increased to 15.
