# Welcome to Phandalin
Nestled on the northern Sword Coast, between Neverwinter Wood and the Sword Mountains, is the town of Phandalin. Centuries ago, Phandalin was a thriving settlement with deep ties to its neighboring communities. But then bandits overran the town, and Phandalin lay abandoned for centuries.

Only in the past few years have settlers built a new village on the ruins of the old. These townsfolk hope to grow Phandalin through hard work, camaraderie, and the shared purpose of building a lasting home. Threatening their efforts and their survival are bandits, brigands, and monsters.

**A typical morning unfolds in the idyllic town of Phandalin

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/welcome-to-phandalin#ThreatsfromBelow)Threats from Below

Unbeknowst to any townsfolk, three mind flayer fanatics lurk deep underneath the town and plot a chilling course.

The fanatics worship Ilvaash, a godlet in the Far Realm, who is determined to reestablish a mind flayer empire on the Material Plane. Ilvaash wants this empire to stretch across Toril’s surface, starting with Phandalin as its capital. (For more information about Ilvaash, see [chapter 8](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/pbtso/beyond-a-lightless-star).)

The mind flayer fanatics have discovered pieces of a shattered obelisk of great magical power, left over from the mysterious Netherese empire that once occupied part of this region. After retrieving the remaining fragments, the fanatics plan to infuse the reconstructed obelisk with Ilvaash’s unholy energy and turn Phandalin’s population into mind flayers loyal to their evil godlet.

This plot is a complex affair, but the mind flayers beneath Phandalin have many allies. As petty bandits vie for control of Phandalin, the fanatics’ allies quietly search for pieces of the shattered obelisk. How successful those allies are—and whether Phandalin’s heroes can stop the will of an evil godlet—is exactly what you’re about to find out!

### [Stonehill Inn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/trouble-in-phandalin#StonehillInn)

In the center of town, opposite the town green, stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.

The Stonehill Inn has five of its six rooms free (Sildar Hallwinter occupies the sixth room). Should the characters need more space or want to stay elsewhere, they can camp outside town, or they can persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.

The inn’s proprietor is a friendly young human man named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered a good opportunity to become established. Toblen doesn’t like the Redbrands at all, though he tries not to make trouble for fear that they might retaliate against his wife and children.

### [Barthen’s Provisions](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/trouble-in-phandalin#BarthensProvisions)

Barthen’s Provisions is the biggest trading post in Phandalin. It stocks most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen’s doesn’t stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, except for items that cost more than 25 gp. Characters who ask for weapons or armor are directed to the Lionshield Coster (see [below](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/trouble-in-phandalin#LionshieldCoster)).

The proprietor is Elmina Barthen, a young human woman with a kindly manner. She employs a couple of clerks, Ander and Thistle, who help load and unload wagons, and who wait on customers when Elmina isn’t around.

Linene Graywind

A wooden sign shaped like a shield and painted with a blue lion hangs above the door of this trading post. The building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city of Yartar, over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has been hit hard by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.)

The owner of the Phandalin post is a human woman named Linene Graywind. She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn’t know who is responsible.

In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale. Linene worries about Phandalin’s safety, however, and won’t sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town.

### [Phandalin Miner’s Exchange](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/trouble-in-phandalin#PhandalinMinersExchange)

The Miner’s Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out. In the absence of any local authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. The exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. There isn’t any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.

Zhentarim Pin

The guild master is a quick-witted and ruthless human woman named Halia Thornton. In her attempts to establish the Miner’s Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working to slowly bring Phandalin under her control, and she can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don’t cross her.

### [Alderleaf Farm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/trouble-in-phandalin#AlderleafFarm)

Qelline Alderleaf is a wise and pragmatic halfling farmer who seems to know everything that goes on in town. She is a kind host and is willing to let the characters stay in her hayloft if they don’t want to stay at the Stonehill Inn.

### [Shrine of Luck](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/trouble-in-phandalin#ShrineofLuck)

Phandalin’s only temple, this small shrine is made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora, the god of luck and good fortune.

The shrine is in the care of a scholarly acolyte named Sister Garaele, a zealous young elf who despairs of ever ridding Phandalin of the Redbrands and other evil influences. Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout Faerûn to thwart tyrants and despots. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin.

### [Sleeping Giant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/trouble-in-phandalin#SleepingGiant)

This run-down tap house is a dirty, dangerous watering hole at the end of Phandalin’s main street. It is frequented by Redbrands and operated by a surly orc named Greska.

### [Townmaster’s Hall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/trouble-in-phandalin#TownmastersHall)

Harbin Wester

Phandalin has no functioning government, but the village elects a “townmaster” each year. The townmaster serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps important records. The current townmaster is a human banker named Harbin Wester, a cheerful and well-liked, but timid leader. Completely intimidated by the Redbrands, Harbin initially claims that they’re “just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really.”

The townmaster’s hall has a small but serviceable jail with two cells. Harbin eventually admits to the characters that the Redbrands should be captured so they can stand trial and potentially be sent to Neverwinter for imprisonment.

### [Tresendar Manor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/pbtso/trouble-in-phandalin#TresendarManor)

More a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of town on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, but its cellars have been converted into a Redbrand stronghold.
