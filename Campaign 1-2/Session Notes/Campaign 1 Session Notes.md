**Dwarven Excavation**

  

The Party have explored the Dwarven Ruins and cleared the settlement of monsters, gaining their second level and treasure (Banshee claiming the coffer with 15 gemstones worth 10gp each and Abbathor Holy Symbol worth 50gp and Thalion claiming the greed statues gemstone worth 10gp).

  
  

**Umbrage Hill**

  

The party leaves Phandalin to make for Umbrage Hill and encounters a group of orcs on the way, defeating the 6 orcs and making their way toward Umbrage Hill. Upon arriving, they battle a Manticore and Thalion nearly accidentally kills Gwynn. The party defeats two manticores and is currently camped at Umbrage Hill, with a note to Harbin Wester that states Gwynn’s safety.

  

**Butterskull Ranch**

The party arrives at Butterskull Ranch to find it’s been wasted and the workers slaughtered, leaving only a farmhouse, the party clears the farmhouse, killing all of the orcs inside and reaching level 3. The party rescues Big Al and returns him to Phandalin.

  

**Gnomengard**

The Party sets off for Gnomengard. Getting ambushed on the way, they swiftly and easily take out the group of goblins and arrive at Gnomengard. Thalion and Faelyn take care of the mimic and the party obtains a Wand of Pyrotechnics, a Hat of Wizardry, a Clockwork Amulet and a Pole of Collapsing. The party encounters Cryovain, the Young White Dragon. The Party barely manages to survive and move on to Phandalin where they end the session resting.

  

**Mountain’s Toe Gold Mine**

The Party heads out to escort Don-Jon Raskin to Mountain’s Toe Gold Mine. On the way, they encounter Cryovain once again and Thalion is killed. Upon being spoken to, Thalion is revived, but at what cost? The Party reaches Mountain’s Toe Gold Mine and meets “The Whiskered Gang” a group of wererats. The Whiskered Gang’s leader sends them to the “Shrine of Savras” where they fight a horde of orcs and ogres and are granted a vision, showing them the location of Cryovain. The party returns to the Gold Mine and confronts the wererats, causing a conflict as the wererats won’t leave the Gold Mine. They are against the impossible odds of 9 wererats and 9 giant rats. Thalion challenges the wererat leader to a 1v1 and wins, forcing the wererats to leave the Gold Mine.

  

**Dragon Barrow**

The Party returns to town where they meet with Steve McQueen, who shortly after joins the party. The party sets off to Dragon Barrow and meets Xanth the centaur. The party heads inside and fights the Invisible Stalker by trapping it in a pit and killing it. Banshee currently holds the Dragon Slayer Greatsword (which has been altered to be held by Faelyn and only her). Thalion acquires a Necklace of Fireballs. The party clears Dragon Barrow and heads back to Phandalin. While in town, Alvine buys a wagon and the party heads off to Axeholm. 

  

**Axeholm**

At Axeholm, the party splits into groups of two and encounters waves of enemies. The parties consisted of Team 1 (Thalion and Alvine), Team 2 (Banshee and Alimira) and Team 3 (Steve and Faelyn). Team 1 defeated 9 giant spiders, Team 2 defeated 9 ghouls and Team 3 defeated 6 ghouls. The Party clears the rest of the dungeon with Banshee gaining the (currently unidentified) Gauntlets of Ogre Power, and Steve gaining the Dread Helm. Steve marries a mannequin (mimic) named Gwendolyn and has two more on his back.

  

**Woodland Manse**

Honestly, I forgot to write notes for this part. The party clears out the woodland manse and fight the orcs at Falcon’s Hunting Lodge and then return home. The party returns to Phandalin and meet Eri, A friend of Tibor Wester who specialises in magical equipment. Alvine obtains the lightning cloak of billowing, Banshee obtains the Gauntlets of Ogre Power, and Thalion gains the Necklace of Fireball. The Party Leaves Phandalin for Icespire Peak.

  

**Icespire Peak**

The Party arrives at Icespire Peak and get into a confrontation with the “Stone-Cold Reavers”, a band of mercenaries who are here to steal the dragon’s loot. They kill Syleen, Brakkis and Jabarl and the session ends there. The party meets Runa and spares her, they proceed through the hold until they meet Cryovain. They battle Cryovain and slay him. The party returns to Phandalin to collect their reward and learn about the “Redbrands”. They set out for Tresendar Manor. **TO BE CONTINUED IN CAMPAIGN 2**
