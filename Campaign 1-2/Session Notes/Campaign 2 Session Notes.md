# Tresendar Manor

The party enters the Redbrand Hideout. They meet Droop. They clear out the hideout and defeat Glasstaff. They learn about the Redbrands being funded by the leader of Cobrakark, Tarook Talon. They return to Phandalin. Droop is revealed to be a Warlock after Thalion attacks him, and he joins the party as their butler.

# Kipper Hollow

The party arrives at Kipper Hollow to find a group of Redbrands pounding on a townsperson's door, demanding a payment in gold. As the party takes a step closer to them, they kick the door down and enter the house, followed by screams. The party enters the house to find it’s devoid of life besides a pool of blood on the ground. They investigate the house, finding a hidden bunker underneath and decide to investigate the bunker. Thalion is hit with a surprise attack from one of the townspeople, but it barely manages to scratch his armour, followed by a voice, down the tunnel, being revealed shortly after to be Steve McQueen’s sister, Ali McQueen.

  

The party is led to a war room, with plans on how to take down Tarook Talon and the Redbrands. Ali gives them a quick rundown of the town, revealing the Inn, the Church, and the Crow’s Nest Casino. The party, shortly after, leaves for the church, aside from Alvine, who scopes out the casino.

  

At the church, the party enters to find a fortune teller, sitting alone across the room, saying that she has been expecting them. She told Faelyn’s fortune, saying, “Your destiny will bring something far greater than you are”, and handed her a medallion, saying, “This will help you later in life”. Steve goes second, “You will be reunited with someone you love from your past”. Thalion third, “There is something inside you, an ancient evil.”, and tries to expel Abbathor from inside him, ultimately failing. Alimira goes fourth, “You have many grand adventures ahead of you”. And lastly, banshee, “There’s someone about you, who is your god?”. After getting their fortunes told, the party leaves and heads to the casino.

  

Alvine doesn’t find much at the casino while he’s scoping it out, only getting some information from the bartender about how great Tarook Talon is and the VIP rooms upstairs. The party arrives and he brings them up to date, telling them that they can gain access to the VIP rooms if they win big on the tables downstairs. They all play blackjack, with Steve and Banshee gaining access to the VIP lounge and getting a +1 each. They head up with Alimira and Faelyn, while Thalion and Alvine teleport to the second floor from outside.

  

They find an empty room upstairs that they claim, while they try to find some way to gain information from Tarook Talon. They spot a small hole in the wall next to the support beams for the roof, leading into Tarook Talon’s office, and Alvine transforms into a rat and is sent in to spy on them. Alvine hears about the obelisk shard, the experiments they are performing with it and the existence of Wave Echo Cave. Tarook stands up, “You can come out now” he says, turning to face Alvine, who runs away. Alvine hides outside the window of the VIP lounge while the party is confronted by the guards to Tarook Talon’s room. They get summoned to Tarook’s office, where he reveals that he knows all about their arrival, the size of their party, and lastly, that he knows Steve McQueen is with them. As Tarook walks towards the elevator, it opens up, revealing a large hooded figure with a mask, named Billy. Tarook orders Billy to kill them and takes the elevator.

  

The party fights Billy, taking down the husks that are with him and dropping his hp to 0. Billy rips off his mask, revealing he’s William McQueen, and throws his gun to Steve, before mutating into a monster. Alimira is downed but not killed, and is shortly healed after, and the party kills William. As William drops to the ground, the shard pierces deeper into his chest, implanting itself into the ground as green cracks begin to form across the town. Banshee attempts to lift the shard with mage hand, but it doesn’t budge.

  

Steve finds the casino’s treasury, with massive piles of gold throughout the back of the room and chests sitting on top of them. Steve attempts to open the chest, activating a glyph of warding, triggering a bomb inside the chest. Alvine uses dispel magic to deactivate it before the bomb explodes, but it was linked to glyphs of warding in the other chests, which activate. The chests all explode, damaging Steve for 99 damage and killing him on the spot. He is revived shortly after by Banshee, using Revivify. The session ends here.
