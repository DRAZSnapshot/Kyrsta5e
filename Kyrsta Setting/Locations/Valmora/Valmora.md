# Aelora

**[[Aelora]]** was once the main region of the Elves before the Great War 250 years ago.

It was created as an unforeseen aftereffect of **[[Zachary Firelink]]** using “The World Splitter” to end the Great War. The fog’s magic is so dense that only a small handful of people have managed to cross from one side to the other. Hidden beneath the fog is a crack in the land that leads into the world's abyss.

Vex is known for it’s lawlessness, the only rules in place, being made by criminal organizations that have made Vex a breeding ground for their greed.

  

# [[The Great War]]

253 Years Ago, the Orc Chieftain,  **[[Morgul]]**, had sought dominion over the continent of Valmora, leading to the formation of the **[[Allied Races]]**. Despite the advantage in numbers and technology, the allied races were being pushed back by the sheer power of the Orcs. 

250 Years Ago, seeing a losing battle, the king of the elves **[[Ailwin Nesta]]** made a deal with Morgul to fight alongside him and in return, his people live. The rest of the allied races had devised a plan, with the help of a wizard named **[[Milton]]**, they would create a magical artifact designed to annihilate the orcs and elves. An elite unit of soldiers was sent to deliver the finished artifact to **[[Zachary Firelink]]** during the battle of **[[Highmarch]]**. Upon delivery, the artifact is taken a blow from a spell woven by Ailwin Nesta, leading to a malfunction, causing the artifact to let out a large explosion of magic, splitting the continent in half and creating a magical fog in it’s place. Zachary Firelink, being in direct contact with the artifact, is afflicted with the curse of the eternal flame, a fire engulfing him that will never die out nor let him perish.
