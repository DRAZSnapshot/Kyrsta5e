### Backstory

Steve McQueen grew up in his family's casino, Wolf's Bane, with a secret guild, Wolveswall, hidden in the basement. The casino was a hub of crime and wealth, and Steve was destined to take over his father's guild when he came of age. His sister, Ali, was a kind soul who never shared her father's passion for the profession. Their father, William McQueen, was a complex figure - kind but strict in his values. He rarely spoke about their mother, who had left soon after Ali's birth, but when he did, he would often compare Ali to her mother, saying she had inherited her heart.

  

As a child, Steve and Ali were woken in the dead of night by the sound of screams and the bright glow of purple flames and dark green smoke engulfing the casino. They would search the house, but their father was nowhere to be found. Assuming he was in the casino, they would venture out to find him, only to discover that the town had turned against them. The casino had been a source of resentment for the townspeople, who felt it had drained them of their wealth. Steve grew up with a deep-seated hatred for sore losers and those who would do anything to exact revenge for a lost gambling debt.

  

After their father's disappearance, Steve and Ali who were chased out of the town with no protection of their father lived in the woods for several weeks before they were taken in by Risha Mada, a half-orc sorcerer who had a strong aversion to gambling. She raised them as her own, teaching Steve the ways of magic and embracing Ali's compassionate nature. As they grew older, Steve and Ali left the woods to make their mark on the world. Risha, aware of Steve's aspirations to rebuild his father's guild, warned him of the dangers that lay ahead. However, she also promised to always be there for him, and Steve vowed to repay her kindness when he finally rebuilt his guild.

  

Now, Steve roams the plains, searching for individuals worthy of the Wolveswall title and seeking to uncover the truth behind the mysterious purple flames that destroyed his father's casino. He is driven by a desire for revenge and a need to avenge his father's death
